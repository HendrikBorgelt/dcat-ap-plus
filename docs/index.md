# DCAT Application Profile for Providing Links to Use-case Specific Context (DCAT-AP+)

This LinkML schema is an extension of the [DCAT Application Profile](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/). 
The purpose of DCAT-AP+ is to provide an additional provenance layer that allows a detailed description of a dataset's generation with  domain-specific metadata in a unified generic manner, based on the [Starting Point Terms of the Provenance Ontology (PROV-O)](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#description-starting-point-terms).
