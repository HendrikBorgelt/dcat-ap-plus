# Design Patterns & Decisions of DCAT-AP+

DCAT-AP is currently limited regarding the ability to provide domain-specific and ontology aligned metadata on what a 
dataset is actually about or on the process used to create it. For specifying the subject of a dataset, there are only 
the properties: `dcterms:description`, `dcterms:keyword` and `dcat:theme`, and for specifying its creation context there 
is the property `prov:wasGeneratedBy` that expects an instance of the `prov:Activity` class.
The former three have the limitation of either expecting only free text, or, in the case of `theme`, only a very small
but too general controlled vocabulary. The limitation of the latter lies i nthe fact that the Activity class is only
considered a "Supportive Entity" and thus not further specified with any properties.

DCAT-AP+ addresses this gap, by mainly reusing the [Starting Point Terms of the Provenance Ontology (PROV-O)](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#description-starting-point-terms), 
but also the [QUDT ontology](https://www.qudt.org/) and the [DCTerms vocabulary](http://purl.org/dc/terms/), as depicted in the following UML 
class diagram (taken from the forthcoming MTSR2025 paper) and the graphical representation of the DCAT-AP+ base pattern.

## Lifting PROV-O's Activity to a first class citizen
We added PROV-O aligned slots (e.g., `had_input_entity`, `had_input_activity`, ...) to the 
[Activity](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/latest/elements/classes/Activity/) class that allow one to further 
specify the input and output of an activity as well as its parts.
To provide the proper ranges for these new slots, we also added the classes [Entity](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/latest/elements/classes/Entity/) and [AgenticEntity](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/latest/elements/classes/AgenticEntity/) based on PROV-O's `Entity` and `Agent` class. 
The renaming of the latter was made due to the fact that DCAT-AP already reuses the `foaf:Agent` class to refer to 
people or organisations somehow responsible for the provenance of a dataset. While the `AgenticEntity` class could be 
used similarly to `foaf:Agnet` to specify people or organisations responsible for an activity taking place, this class 
is rather intended to be used for specifying the tools used in activities.

### Dedicated classes for the data generation context
Since DCAT-AP+ focuses particularly on the kind of activity that created a dataset (e.g., a certain spectroscopy), we 
defined a subclass of `Activity`, called [DataGeneratingActivity](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/latest/elements/classes/DataGeneratingActivity/) and used it instead as the range of the 
[was_generated_by](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/latest/elements/classes/was_generated_by/) property.
This class it is related to the additional classes [EvaluatedEntity](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/latest/elements/classes/EvaluatedEntity/) 
and [EvaluatedActivity](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/latest/elements/classes/EvaluatedActivity/) with 
slots that are specializations of the ones inherited from its parent class. These two new classes represent the entity 
or process that was being evaluated by a `DataGeneratingActivity`, so what the resulting dataset is actually about. 
Consequently, these two classes were also related directly to the `Dataset` class via the `is_about_entity` and 
`is_about_activity` slots.

To be able to represent uses cases in which a dataset was generated by a `DataGeneratingActivity` that is actually an 
analysis of previously generated data, we also added the subclasses [DataAnalysis](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/latest/elements/classes/DataAnalysis/), [AnalysisDataset](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/latest/elements/classes/AnalysisDataset/) and [AnalysisSourceData](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/latest/elements/classes/AnalysisSourceData/).

## Providing additional characteristics

To allow describing instances of the newly introduced classes with additional qualitative or quantitative attributes in 
a very generic manner, we also introduced the [QuantitativeAttribute](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/latest/elements/classes/) class (aligned with `qudt:Quantity`) and the 
[QualititativeAttribute](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/latest/elements/classes/QualitativeAttribute/) class 
(aligned with `prov:Entity`).

## Classification via domain-specific controlled vocabularies and ontologies

With the [ClassifierMixin](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/latest/elements/classes/ClassifierMixin/), 
we provide two properties for semantic annotation to all DCAT-AP+ core classes:

* [rdf_type](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/latest/elements/classes/rdf_type/): Mapped to the RDF property 
`rdf:type`, this allows an instance to be additionally typed with a class from an external ontology (e.g., classifying
a DataGeneratingActivity instance with CHMO:0000595 for a ¹³C NMR measurement). An approach endorsed by the DCAT-AP
developers [31]
* [type](https://nfdi-de.github.io/dcat-ap-plus/latest/elements/classes/type/): Mapped to `dcterms:type`, this allows 
for classification using a term from SKOS vocabularies or other controlled term sets without making such a strong 
ontological commitment as with rdf_type.

## On the naming and ontological alignment of DCAT-AP+ classes and slots
The classes and slots defined within this LinkML model are not to be confused with the ontological classes and 
properties to which they are aligned. DCAT-AP+ is, just like DCAT-AP, an application profile (aka graph shape) that
specifies how certain ontologies and vocabularies are to be used/instantiated. So our DCAT-AP+ LinkML classes and slots 
are to be interpreted just like SHACL node and property shapes. As such it is allowed to have 
different classes (aka node shapes) or slots (aka property shapes) aligned to the same ontological term.
